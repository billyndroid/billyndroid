- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve 
- 👀 I’m interested in front end web development. J have been using Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator and After Effects for around ten years and have recently started learning HTML/CSS inc. SaSS & Bootstrap and Javascript. My experience with Adobe, in particular, jargon used has made this a smoother journey that it might have been. Looking forward to improving Javascript, building some projects, get to know JQuery,  React and possibly Web3, collaborate with some folks on open source projects and finally, getting employment as a front-end developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on generative art projects, or vanilla javascript for practice.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
