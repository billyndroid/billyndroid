- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve 
- 👀 I’m interested in front end web development. 
- 
- I have been using Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator and After Effects for around twelve years and been learning HTML and CSS for around two years. I have also been learning vanilla Javascript. 

- Looking forward to improving Javascript, building some new projects, getting to grips with JQuery and React, collaborating with some folks on open source projects and getting employment as a front-end developer. 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript & JQuery
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on generative art projects, or vanilla javascript for practice.
